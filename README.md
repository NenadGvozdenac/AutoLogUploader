# AutoLogUploader
An autouploader tool that automatically uploads files to my server that receives it, and processes that data.

## How to use?
### Initial Startup
- At startup, you will be prompted to select a directory that stores your files.
- When selecting the directory, make sure it's the parent directory of all uploads.
- Typically, that directory name is *arcdps.cbtlogs*.
- After going to that directory, select *Finish*.

### Recording files
- Upon starting the real application, you will need to start the recording of all logs.
- Once pressed 'Start recording', you will be recording for all files that come into your directory.
- Once you are done, you may either stop the application, or *Stop recording*.

### Changing the directory
- If you are unsatisfied with your directory, that is stored in *path.json*, you may choose to press *Change directory*.
- Once you choose that directory, press *Finish*, and that's it.
